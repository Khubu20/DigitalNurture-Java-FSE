ðŸ“˜ Java Deep Skilling â€“ Week 1
This directory contains hands-on implementations from the DigitalNurture Java FSE Deep Skilling Program (Week 1). It includes both creational design patterns and basic data structures & algorithm exercises.

ðŸ”¹ Design Patterns â€“ Creational
ðŸ§© Singleton Pattern
ðŸ“„ Main.java

Ensures only one instance of a class exists

Uses:

Private constructor

Static instance

Lazy initialization

âœ… Output:
Singleton instance created. Hello from Singleton! true


ðŸ§© Factory Method Pattern
ðŸ“„ Factory.java

Allows object creation without exposing creation logic

Uses:

Interface: Shape

Factory: ShapeFactory

Concrete Classes: Circle, Rectangle

âœ… Output:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Drawing Circle...
Drawing Rectangle...
ðŸ”¹ Data Structures & Algorithms:

ðŸ“¦ E-commerce Search
ðŸ“„ SearchExample.java

Features:

Search products by Name (Binary), ID (Linear), or Category

Uses arrays, loops, custom comparator, and Scanner for input

ðŸŒ± Financial Forecast
ðŸ“„ Forecast.java

Calculates future value using recursion

Inputs:

Initial amount

Annual growth rate

Time (in years)

âœ… Example Output:
Future value after 5 years: â‚¹16105.10
