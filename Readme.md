---

## 🔸 PL/SQL Exercises

### 🧮 Exercise 1: Control Structures

#### 🏦 Scenario 1: Senior Citizen Loan Discount  
📄 `SeniorCitizenLoanDiscount.sql`  
- Loops through all customers  
- If age > 60, applies a 1% discount to their loan interest rates

#### 🌟 Scenario 2: VIP Customer Promotion  
📄 `VipCustomerPromotion.sql`  
- Iterates through all customers

## 🧪 JUnit Testing Exercises

### 🔧 Exercise 1: Setting Up JUnit

📄 `JUnitSetup.md`  
- Create a new Java project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)  
- Add JUnit dependency to your project using Maven.


## 🧪 Mockito Hands-On Exercises

This section contains exercises that focus on **unit testing using Mockito**, a powerful mocking framework for Java. These tasks are designed to help you test dependencies, stub method behavior, and verify interactions in a clean and controlled environment.

---

### 🔁 Exercise 1: Mocking and Stubbing

**Scenario:**  
You need to test a service that depends on an external API. Instead of calling the real API, you use Mockito to mock the dependency and stub its methods.

**Steps:**  
1. Create a mock object for the external API.  
2. Stub the methods to return predefined values.  
3. Write a test case that uses the mock object and validates the result using assertions.

---

### ✅ Exercise 2: Verifying Interactions

**Scenario:**  
You want to ensure that a particular method is called with specific arguments during the test execution.

**Steps:**  
1. Create a mock object.  
2. Use it in your service logic.  
3. After execution, use Mockito's `verify()` to check whether a method was called.

---

###git add .
📌 Key Concepts

- **Mocking** allows you to simulate real objects without executing actual logic.
- **Stubbing** sets up expectations: "if this method is called, return this value".
- **Verification** ensures specific methods were invoked (with or without arguments).
- Useful when writing **unit tests** for classes with dependencies such as APIs, databases, or services.

## 🗂 Week 3 Overview
Hands-on with **Spring Core**, **Maven**, and **Spring Data JPA**.

---

## ✅ Exercise 1: Spring Core Setup

- Create Maven project `LibraryManagement`
- Add Spring Core dependencies in `pom.xml`
- Create `applicationContext.xml` in `src/main/resources`
- Define beans: `BookService`, `BookRepository`
- Create classes:
  - `com.library.service.BookService`
  - `com.library.repository.BookRepository`
- Load Spring context in main class to test setup

---

## ✅ Exercise 2: Dependency Injection

- Wire `BookRepository` into `BookService` via XML
- Add setter in `BookService`
- Test using main class

---

## 🧪 Spring Data JPA

### Setup

- Tools: MySQL, Eclipse, Maven

- Dependencies: Spring Data JPA, DevTools, MySQL Driver
- DB: Create schema `ormlearn`

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA ormlearn;

application.properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ormlearn
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect

```

📦 Entity & Repository

Country.java

@Entity
@Table(name = "country")
public class Country {
    @Id @Column(name = "code") private String code;
    @Column(name = "name") private String name;
    // Getters, Setters, toString()
}

CountryRepository.java

@Repository
public interface CountryRepository extends JpaRepository<Country, String> {}

        return countryRepo.findAll();
    }
}


---

🔎 Testing

@SpringBootApplication
public class OrmLearnApplication {
    private static CountryService countryService;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(...);
        countryService = context.getBean(CountryService.class);
        testGetAllCountries();
    }

    private static void testGetAllCountries() {
        List<Country> countries = countryService.getAllCountries();
        System.out.println(countries);
    }
}

# Week5 - Microservices

## Creating Microservices for Account and Loan

In this hands-on exercise, we will create two microservices for a bank:
- One microservice for handling **accounts**
- One for handling **loans**

Each microservice will be a specific independent **Spring RESTful Web Service** Maven project, having its own `pom.xml`.

Instead of combining both account and loan functionalities into a single application, we will split them into **two separate applications**. These web services will be simple and **will not connect to any backend or database**.

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Implement the Two Microservices

---

### 📁 Account Microservice

1. Create a folder with your **employee ID** in the `D:` drive.
2. Inside that folder, create another folder named **`microservices`**.
   - This will contain all your sample projects for microservices learning.
3. Open [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/) in your browser.
4. Fill in the form as follows:
   - **Group**: `com.cognizant`
   - **Artifact**: `account`
5. Select the following modules:
   - `Spring Boot DevTools` under Developer Tools
   - `Spring Web` under Web
6. Click **Generate** and download the zip file.
7. Extract the `account` folder from the zip and move it to the `microservices` folder.
8. Open Command Prompt in the `account` folder and run:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
